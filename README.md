Welcome to my Minishell project, it's my minishell 2 from Epitech 1st year.
This project is a shell with a basic execution plus some pipes, redirections, and some builtins:
  - cd, env, setenv, unsetenv

To try out my shell, 
Clone the repository and go into then type: make
and then you can launch the shell with this command : ./mysh

Enjoy and feel free to give me some improvement point for it.
Soon my 42sh wich is a project of 5 to build a full shell will be uploaded.

./mysh(1)

NAME
        ./mysh - A C shell coded by an Epitech Rennes student.

SYNOPSYS
        - ./mysh -h -> display this help text on the standard output and exit.
        - echo "[commands]" | ./mysh -> execute the command passed in the echo and exit.
        - ./mysh -> Enter the terminal interface and then you can write any command that will be executed
        but the exit value is only returned when the command exit is done.

DESCRIPTION
        mysh is the resut of the minishell 2 project of Epitech so we can do almost everything like a standard shell like tcsh.
        Including pipes, redirection and all the commands that are installed on your computer

RETURN VALUE
        ./mysh return the return value of the command so to check for errors you need to check the man of the command you execute.
        There is only one specific return value wich is 84 that means that an error occured in the shell itself like a
        malloc failure or else
